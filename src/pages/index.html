            <p>Logitech’s new G413 keyboard certainly looks the part, either in the classic Silver design (brushed aluminum casing with white backlighting) or the Carbon (black-anodized with blood red LEDs). But as an advanced mechanical, gaming-focused keyboard, it does more than just look hot. Skeptical? Don’t be. Because…</p>

                These aren’t just any old switches, and they don’t rely on rubber domes with an undetectable
                actuation point either. They’re dedicated, pro-level mechanical switches with solid,
                mush-free and totally trustworthy action.

                The Romer-Gs are carefully designed. Actuation requires a feathery 45g, and the key
                fires—with a click you can feel—after just 1.5mm. Their total travel is actually 3mm,
                so unlike membrane keys there’s no hard stop at the actuation point. Actuation time
                is 25 percent quicker than rival mechanical switches, and almost twice as fast as
                ordinary membrane switches.

            <h3>It’ll make you more accurate</h3>
            <p>The G413 offers 26-key rollover, meaning it can handle you pressing 26 keys at once—say
                because you’re playing an RPG and life’s getting complicated, or because you’ve accidentally
                 started reading the comments somewhere and all your dreams for the future have collapsed,
                 along with your upper body.</p>
            <p>What’s more, the dedicated gaming mode deactivates problem keys (such as the Windows key) in
                 case you do fumble.</p>
            <p>The G413 ships with 12 additional gaming keys, plus a key puller, for full customizability. </p>

            <p>Sound is vital in creating emotional responses—just ask anyone who’s smiled at the thunk of a luxury car’s door. And you just can’t beat the rumble of proper mechanical switches in full gaming flow. The Romer-Gs, however, offer a more silent gaming experience that won’t distract you with unnecessary noise in the heat of virtual battle. </p>
